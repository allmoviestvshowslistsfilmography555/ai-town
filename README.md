[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pierpo/phaser3-simple-rpg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pierpo/phaser3-simple-rpg)

## Presentation

This is just an ambition free project that I developed as an exercice with Typescript and Phaser.

Some things are out-to-date and some patterns I hadn't the knowledge of would greatly improve the readability now!

Also, it needs some upgrades in the dependencies (the Phaser version here is becoming old!)

## Prerequisites

- Node 10
- yarn
- A recent browser (Chrome 67)
- [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) for map edition

## Installation

```bash
yarn       # install the dependencies
yarn start # run the dev server
```

That's it ðŸ˜Š
